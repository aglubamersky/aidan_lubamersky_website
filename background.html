      <p> My name is Aidan Lubamersky. I was born in San Francisco and have lived in Marin for my whole life.<br>
        I have a twin brother named Liam and a younger brother named Seamus.
        My dad has lived in Marin his whole <br>life as well, and my mom lived in Loomis, California before
        moving out to the bay. I am now <br>a senior San Rafael High School and look forward to wherever
        I end up going for school in the future.

    <h2> Personality </h2>
      <p> I like to think of myself as a laid back person. My favorite hobbies includeplaying football, playing videogames,<br> writing, and telling only the funniest of jokes to my friends. </p>
