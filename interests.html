    <hr>
    <p> I have been playing football since I was a freshman at San Rafael.
        I love football because I feel like there is a stronger sense of comradery
        <br>associated with it than any other sport I have played. I have only
        been playing football for 4 years, but it has become a huge part of my life
        <br>and have met many of my best friends playing football.
