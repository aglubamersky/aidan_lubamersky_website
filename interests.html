    <h1>Interests</h1>
    <hr>
      <p> I have been playing football since I was a freshman at San Rafael.
        I love football because <br>I feel like there is a stronger sense of comradery
        associated with it than any other sport I have played.<br> I have only
        been playing football for 4 years, but it has become a huge part of my life
        <br>and have met many of my best friends playing football.
